#SUMMARYâ€¯ 

We are making a database for a social media platform inspired by the popular application Reddit with similar features, but with our own tweaks. Our domain will model basic social networking concepts, such as users, communities, posts, comments, messages, attachments, chat rooms, and awards. The user interactions are modeled in the relationships between entities where users can join communities, follow other users, make posts and comments with attachments, give awards to and upvote/downvote posts and comments, and enter chat to message other users.
